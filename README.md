# **Project: Imp**

**Initial Modding Platform**

---

## **Introduction**

Welcome to **Project: Imp**, a journey into transforming the Toybox Alpha V1 3D Printer into a modder's dream. This repository documents step-by-step explorations of hardware and firmware modifications designed to push the limits of this small yet capable printer.

While the focus is on the V1 electronics—featuring an ESP12 controller and an STM32F103—the Toybox Alpha V1 and V2 share the same mechanical design, meaning most mods should be compatible with both versions.

**Project: Imp** is about more than upgrades; it’s a platform for ingenuity, experimentation, and creating a modders' haven. We’re not making promises—just sharing our journey as it unfolds.

## **Disclaimer**

**This project is intended for experienced users or those eager to dive deeper into 3D printing and customization.** Modifying your printer may void warranties and carries risks that could potentially damage your hardware. Proceed with caution and only attempt these modifications if you’re comfortable with troubleshooting and problem-solving. This is not a beginner’s guide; it’s an adventure into advanced 3D printing.

## **Current Focus**

We are currently exploring:

- **Successful BTT SKR Pico and Pi Zero 2 Deployment:** A confirmed deployment of this configuration has expanded the capabilities of the platform.
- **Getting Klipper Running on Stock Hardware:** Further investigation is underway to adapt Klipper to the Toybox Alpha’s original electronics for broader accessibility.
- **Generic Marlin Profile Development:** Efforts are being made to create a versatile Marlin configuration for users preferring the classic firmware experience.
- **Understanding the Toybox Alpha V1’s limitations:** Identifying areas for improvement and modification.
- **Mechanical Modifications:** Testing tweaks to enhance performance, compatible with both V1 and V2 models.
