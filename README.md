**Initial Modding Platform**

---

## **Introduction**

Welcome to **Project: Imp**, an innovative open-source initiative dedicated to enhancing the Toybox Alpha V1 3D Printer. This project documents step-by-step explorations of hardware and firmware modifications, turning this small but capable printer into a versatile platform for creative experimentation and advanced customization.

Designed for experienced users and tinkerers, **Project: Imp** focuses on unlocking the full potential of the Toybox Alpha V1. While the primary target is the V1 electronics‚Äîfeaturing an ESP12 controller and an STM32F103‚Äîthe V1 and V2 models share the same mechanical structure, making most modifications compatible across versions.

Our ultimate goal is to create a modders' haven, where innovation meets accessibility. This repository combines practical knowledge and AI-driven insights to help users push boundaries and explore new possibilities.
