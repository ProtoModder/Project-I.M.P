# üìö MKS Robin Nano V1 Firmware Configuration (Tuorum Repo)

## üìñ Overview
This repository contains **Marlin firmware configuration files** (`Configuration.h` and `Configuration_adv.h`) tailored for the **MKS Robin Nano V1** mainboard, commonly used in Toybox Alpha 3D printers. Developed by **Tuorum**, these configurations optimize hardware performance and enable advanced features.

**Note:** This firmware was developed and tested on a **Toybox Alpha model featuring the GD32F303VET6 processor**. Current retail versions of the Toybox Alpha may use the **STM32F303VET6 processor**, and compatibility may vary. Please verify your mainboard processor version before flashing.

## üöÄ How to Flash the Firmware

### üì§ **Method 1: Flash via SD Card**
1. **Rename the Firmware File:**  
   - Ensure the firmware file is named **`Robin_nano35.bin`**.
2. **Copy to SD Card:**  
   - Place the renamed file in the **root directory** of your SD card.
3. **Insert SD Card:**  
   - Insert the SD card into your printer's SD card slot.
4. **Power Cycle the Printer:**  
   - Turn on the printer. The firmware will automatically flash.
5. **Verify Installation:**  
   - After flashing, the file may rename itself to `Robin_nano35.cur`, indicating a successful installation.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Method 2: Flash via USB (STM32CubeProgrammer)**
1. Replace `Configuration.h` and `Configuration_adv.h` in your Marlin source directory.
2. Compile firmware using [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/).
3. Flash via [STM32CubeProgrammer](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeprog.html).
